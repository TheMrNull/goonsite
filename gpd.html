        <h1>🪪 The Gooner Party Card — Your Official GP Membership</h1>
        <article>
The Gooner Party Card is the one and only official membership card of the Great Gooner Party (GP), granting exclusive access to the most prestigious (and most ridiculous) corners of the Gooner universe. This card isn’t just a piece of plastic — it’s your official proof of allegiance to the cause of Goonology and everything the GP represents.

But beware: the Gooner Party Card is no joke to obtain. Only the GP Admissions Office has the power to issue these cards, and they can only be requested through the official regional bulletin or by being selected directly by the Party itself. In other words, you can’t simply buy your way into the Gooner elite — you must earn your spot… or be chosen.

There are two types of membership, each unlocking different levels of secrets and absurd power:

<ul>
    <li><h4>🎖️ Standard Membership: </h4>
    <article>For those who support the GP and want to carry the badge of honor but don’t need the inner-circle secrets. Still cool, but not that cool.
    </article></li>
    <li><h4>🌟 Premium Membership</h4><article>The Premium Gooner Party Card takes your membership to the next level, unlocking access to a world of exclusive content, insider previews, and classified developments, including:
        <ul><li>Early and exclusive previews on the development and release of Project Gorgonzola — the top-secret, highly anticipated video game that will shake the foundations of gaming (or at least mildly confuse them).</li>
        <li>Exclusive insights into the creation and upcoming launch of GoonOS, the official operating system of the GP — optimized for productivity, gooning, and general absurdity.</li>
        <li>VIP Access to MagliaGPT, the cutting-edge AI developed by the GP, available exclusively to Premium members upon release.</li>
        <li>And much more, only for the eyes of Premium Gooners.</li></ul>
    </article></li>
</ul>

<h4>⏳ Processing Time</h4>

Once your request is approved (or you’ve been selected by destiny), your Gooner Party Card will be crafted with care and shipped to you within 1 to 7 working days, ready to unlock the privileges of true Gooner status.
