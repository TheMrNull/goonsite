        You might be scrolling on your phone and come across words like drip, ice, skibidi, delulu, simp and more, you might be even using them, but do you really know where they come from? 
If you don’t, then this article is ready to spill the tea about the story of some gen-z and gen-alpha slang you might be using:

Skibidi: this word is considered to be a nonsense word, as it does not carry a specific meaning, but its history is fascinating. It all started with the meme song: “Skibidi bop bop yes yes”, by Biser King, a Bulgarian singer. This song was later on used in a famous Turkish dancing video I bet all of you know and its success was coronated with the web series “Skibidi-toilet” in 2023, which is centered on a skibidi-toilet invasion.

Sigma: this word describes an individual, usually a man, who is not willing to conform to societal norms and often thinks outside the box. This word was used to describe men that didn’t identify in the alpha male category, or in the beta male category, and therefore were independent, without having to base their personality on an existing ideal. They had to come up with another greek letter and Σ was by far the best option. Why? Because Σ is used to sum a set of values and therefore represented completion.

Rizz: this words derived from the word “charisma” (chaRIZZma) and has a flirtatious connotation, as it describes the action of flirting with romantic intent. This word originated in 2020, mainly on tiktok and soon became used by the community online and had huge success.

Simp: this word refers to people that excessively admire or do things for someone they are attracted by. This word originated from the term “simpleton”, referring to naive or foolish people. This word originated in 2010 and usually has a very negative connotation, so negative that the well known streaming platform “Twitch” banned it, as it was seen as particularly offensive. 

Slay: this word originally meant "to kill" or "to destroy," but in its slang form, it evolved over time to refer to doing something in an outstanding way. It originated in particular in the LGBTQ community and became quickly a part of girls’ slang. This word is generally used nowadays to praise someone’s appearance or style.
